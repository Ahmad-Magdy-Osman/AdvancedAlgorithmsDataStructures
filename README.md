# :evergreen_tree: Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures - CS360 :snake:

XML and Drawing, Arrays, Hashing, HashSet, HashMap, Recursion, Ordered Tree Set, Sudoku Solver, Graphs, Dijkstras, PriorityQueue, Heaps, Kruskals, Bloom Filter, Trie, AVL Tree, BTree.

I took this class in Fall 2018. Each folder is its own project with the implementation of one or more data structure and/or algorithm. Usually, for each project, the implementation would focus on the optimization of the time/space complexity for insertion/lookup/removal/etc and then build a project to solve a certain problem using the implement data structure and/or algorithm. The projects are all in Python and can be walked through easily. Projects include:

* AVL Tree

* BTree

* Bloom Filter

* Dijkstras using Ordered Tree Set

* Dijkstras using Priority Queue

* HashSet

* Kruskals

* MISC
  * General Notes
  * Notes
    * Code/Pictures/Explanations
  * Review Questions and Answers
  * Exam Questions Review

* Ordered Tree Set

* Sudoku Solver

* Trie

* XML and Drawing

Feel free to clone this repository and to explore the projects.
