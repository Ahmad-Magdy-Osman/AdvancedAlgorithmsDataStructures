Please review Python Object-Oriented programming, magic methods, computational complexity, and amortized complexity. Review datatypes like Stack and Queue (from chapter 4) so you are prepared to answer questions and/or write some code pertaining to these fundamental datatypes. Be sure to understand the O(1) complexity of append in the modified PyList datatype and why it achieves an amortized complexity of O(1) for append.
