Heap: 
    A balanced Binary Tree. 
    The root of the heap is the smallest (or greatest).
    The lft and right subtrees are also heaps.
    Heap is a complete binary tree.

    Full binary tree: each parent has a full... Read this for the differences http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs163/Doc/FullvsComplete.html

Example
    Build a heap for these values:
        10, 5, 8, 7, 2, 9, 4

parentIdx = (childIdx -1) // 2
childIdx1 = parentIdx * 2 + 1
childIdx2 = parentIdx * 2 + 2

Complexity of building heaps are O(n), worst case for each elemnt is O(log n), best is O(1)
