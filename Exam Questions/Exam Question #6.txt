The test question will be over BloomFilters and Trie
    Write a little code
    Understand the code well engough
        contains methods for both
        insert method
    He won't ask to figure the number of hashes or bits for the bloom filter
        We won't be writing the code for that
    We should understand the computational complexity of both data structures
    
    For the bloomfilter, the complexity is not dependendent via the natural log on the false positives
        For all practical purposes, the number of hash functions do not grow significantly...
            The number of hashes do not affect us
    
        To conclude that, finally: The complexity of the bloom filter is big oh of 1 for insertion and lookup... It is very close to Big oh of 1

    For the trie, it is bounded by a constant (26 letters for the spell checkers)... 
        Big Oh of 1 for lookup and insertions. Not just very close. It is Big oh of 1
